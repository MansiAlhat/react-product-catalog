üí° Challenges Faced and Solutions
Issue with Layout Responsiveness:
Problem: When filtering or sorting products, the page size dynamically changed based on the number of cards.
Solution: We ensured consistent card grid alignment by applying proper CSS flexbox/grid rules. This was managed with appropriate min-height and grid-template-columns configurations to maintain uniformity.

Dynamic Page Size on Detail View:
Problem: Clicking on product details sometimes caused alignment issues.
Solution: Fixed the container layout to ensure the detail view is positioned correctly within a consistent parent structure.

‚ú® Optional Enhancements
Added Sort by Price functionality for an improved user experience.
Ensured full responsiveness for all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
Designed the UI to maintain a modern and clean look using flexbox and custom CSS.
